abstract = {Dysregulation of phosphatidyl inositol signaling occurs in many cancers and other disorders. The lipid and protein phosphatase, PTEN (Phosphatase and Tensin homology protein on chromosome 10), is a known tumor suppressor whose function is frequently lost in various malignancies due to mutations in the coding region or genomic deletions. Recently, another lipid phosphatase, Inositol Polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B), has emerged as a potential tumor suppressor in prostate, breast, and ovarian cancers and possibly in leukemia. We will review its structure and function, crosstalk with androgen receptor signaling, and regulation of INPP4B expression, as well as existing data about its role in cancer.},

abstract = {PPP2R2A deletions were recently linked to a subgroup of luminal breast carcinoma (BC) that exhibits poor survival. This subgroup also exhibited amplification of a chromosome region containing the Cyclin D1 coding gene, CCND1. Therefore, we aimed to investigate whether a combination of PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$) and Cyclin D1 expression statuses evaluated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) could define a subgroup of luminal BC that exhibits poor survival. First we conducted a retrospective cohort study using sequencing data from The Cancer Genome Atlas initiative to correlate PPP2R2A copy number alteration (CNA) status with its expression level and the corresponding overall survival (OS). Next, also using a retrospective cohort study design, we evaluated the PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$) expression levels by IHC in a total of 807 BC patients from two independent cohorts (discovery cohort n = 349 and validation cohort n = 458). Cyclin D1 expression was also evaluated, and the PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$)-/low/Cyclin D1high phenotype was evaluated as a predictor of disease-free survival (DFS) and OS in luminal-like BC patients. Deletions in the PPP2R2A gene strongly correlate with lower mRNA expression and poorer OS. PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$)-/low carcinomas have significantly shorter DFS and OS. Furthermore, in univariate analysis, the PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$)-/low/Cyclin D1high phenotype is significantly associated with poorer DFS and OS. In a multivariate analysis, the PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$)-/low/Cyclin D1high phenotype is significantly associated with poor DFS, thus defining a group of luminal-like BC with higher risk of relapse. We demonstrate that BCs harboring PPP2R2A deletions are associated with worse OS. Moreover, this is the first study to demonstrate that the combination of altered PPP2R2A (B55$\alpha$) and high Cyclin D1 expression by IHC defines a subgroup of luminal-like BC patients with a high risk of relapse and death.},

abstract = {Cancer cells possess traits reminiscent of those ascribed to normal stem cells. It is unclear, however, whether these phenotypic similarities reflect the activity of common molecular pathways. Here, we analyze the enrichment patterns of gene sets associated with embryonic stem (ES) cell identity in the expression profiles of various human tumor types. We find that histologically poorly differentiated tumors show preferential overexpression of genes normally enriched in ES cells, combined with preferential repression of Polycomb-regulated genes. Moreover, activation targets of Nanog, Oct4, Sox2 and c-Myc are more frequently overexpressed in poorly differentiated tumors than in well-differentiated tumors. In breast cancers, this ES-like signature is associated with high-grade estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, often of the basal-like subtype, and with poor clinical outcome. The ES signature is also present in poorly differentiated glioblastomas and bladder carcinomas. We identify a subset of ES cell-associated transcription regulators that are highly expressed in poorly differentiated tumors. Our results reveal a previously unknown link between genes associated with ES cell identity and the histopathological traits of tumors and support the possibility that these genes contribute to stem cell-like phenotypes shown by many tumors.},

abstract = {In the United States there are 225,000 new cases of invasive breast cancer annually, and at least 50,000 women are diagnosed with ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). Breast cancer is a collection of disorders of mammary epithelial cells with distinct pathological characteristics and diverse clinical manifestations. Breast cancers are divided broadly into four classes by the level of the biomarkers HER2 (erbB2/neu) and the estrogen receptor (ER). Histologic grade is also an important modifier of breast cancer taxonomy and behavior. Broadly speaking, breast cancer can be divided into those that are HER2-positive, containing cancers that are both ER-positive and negative, cancers that are ER-positive and divided into high-grade and low-grade tumors, and the remaining but important class of cancers that are both ER-negative and HER2-negative. These last cancers are called basal-like and were first recognized as a distinct group by gene expression arrays. Nuclear factor kappaB (NF-$\kappa$B) is family of multifunctional transcription factors that when activated generate pleotrophic changes in target cells. Elevated levels of active NF-$\kappa$B are detected in many human diseases including breast cancers. High-level active NF-$\kappa$B is detected in specific subclasses of breast cancers briefly described above, predominantly in ER-negative and epidermal growth factor family receptor (EGFR) overexpressing breast cancers (predominantly HER2 amplified cancers). This article is focused on the role of NF-$\kappa$B activation initiated by the EGFR family receptors in subclasses of breast cancer. The combined influence of EGFR family receptors and NF-$\kappa$B signaling on the transformation of ER-negative human mammary epithelial cell is illustrated. J. Cell.

We report the structure-guided development of 6-acrylamido-4-anilinoquinazoline irreversible kinase inhibitors that potently and selectively target rationally designed kinases bearing two selectivity elements that are not found together in any wild-type kinase: an electrophile-targeted cysteine residue and a glycine gatekeeper residue. Cocrystal structures of two irreversible quinazoline inhibitors bound to either epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) or engineered c-Src show covalent inhibitor binding to the targeted cysteine (Cys797 in EGFR and Cys345 in engineered c-Src). To accommodate the new covalent bond, the quinazoline core adopts positions that are different from those seen in kinase structures with reversible quinazoline inhibitors. Based on these structures, we developed a fluorescent 6-acrylamido-4-anilinoquinazoline affinity probe to report the fraction of kinase necessary for cellular signaling, and we used these reagents to quantitate the relationship between EGFR stimulation by EGF and its downstream outputs-Akt, Erk1 and Erk2.},

abstract = {Five models have been built by the ICM method for the Comparative Modeling section of the Meeting on the Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein Structure Prediction. The targets have homologous proteins with known three-dimensional structure with sequence identity ranging from 25 to 77{\%}. After alignment of the target sequence with the related three-dimensional structure, the modeling procedure consists of two subproblems: side-chain prediction and loop prediction. The ICM method approaches these problems with the following steps: (1) a starting model is created based on the homologous structure with the conserved portion fixed and the nonconserved portion having standard covalent geometry and free torsion angles; (2) the Biased Probability Monte Carlo (BPMC) procedure is applied to search the subspaces of either all the nonconservative side-chain torsion angles or torsion angles in a loop backbone and surrounding side chains. A special algorithm was designed to generate low-energy loop deformations. The BPMC procedure globally optimizes the energy function consisting of ECEPP/3 and solvation energy terms. Comparison of the predictions with the NMR or crystallographic solutions reveals a high proportion of correctly predicted side chains. The loops were not correctly predicted because imprinted distortions of the backbone increased the energy of the near-native conformation and thus made the solution unrecognizable. Interestingly, the energy terms were found to be reliable and the sampling of conformational space sufficient. The implications of this finding for the strategies of future comparative modeling are discussed.},

abstract = {PKB/AKT constitutes an important pathway that regulates the signaling of multiple essential biological processes. PTEN is a dual protein/lipid phosphatase whose main substrate is phosphatidyl-inositol,3,4,5 triphosphate (PIP3), the product of PI3K. Increases in PIP3 result in the recruitment of PDK1 and AKT to the membrane where they are activated. Furthermore, PI3K can be activated by direct binding to oncogenic Ras proteins. Many components of this pathway have been described as genetically altered in cancer. PTEN activity is lost by mutations, deletions or promoter methylation at high frequency in many primary and metastatic human cancers, and some germline mutations of PTEN are found in several familial cancer predisposition syndromes. Activating mutations of PI3K occur in human tumors and confer tumorigenic properties to cells in culture. Taken together, this evidence indicates that the AKT pathway is a promising potential target for cancer chemotherapy. Indeed, many companies and academic laboratories have initiated a variety of approaches to inhibit the pathway at different points. Essentially, PI3Ks, PDK1, AKT and mTOR are heavily targeted for therapy in different ways. These proteins are kinases, which are very "druggable" targets a priori, and, according to the "addiction hypothesis", cancer cells with the activated pathway will be more dependent on its activity for their survival.},

abstract = {The estrogen receptor is the master transcriptional regulator of breast cancer phenotype and the archetype of a molecular therapeutic target. We mapped all estrogen receptor and RNA polymerase II binding sites on a genome-wide scale, identifying the authentic cis binding sites and target genes, in breast cancer cells. Combining this unique resource with gene expression data demonstrates distinct temporal mechanisms of estrogen-mediated gene regulation, particularly in the case of estrogen-suppressed genes. Furthermore, this resource has allowed the identification of cis-regulatory sites in previously unexplored regions of the genome and the cooperating transcription factors underlying estrogen signaling in breast cancer. Recent work has focused on identifying gene expression signatures in breast cancer subtypes that predict response to specific treatment regimes and improved disease outcome 1–4 . Tumors with gene expres-sion profiles that correlate with estrogen receptor a (hereafter referred to simply as 'estrogen receptor') expression have been termed luminal type 1,5 and are associated with response to endocrine therapy and improved survival, although the mechanisms by which estrogen receptor dictates tumor status are poorly understood. Estrogen receptor–mediated transcription has been intensively studied on a small number of endogenous target promoters 6–8 , and recent location analysis of estrogen receptor binding by chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with microarrays (ChIP-on-chip) also focused primarily on promoter regions 9,10 . We recently expanded on these analyses to map estrogen receptor binding sites in a less biased way that did not depend on preexisting concepts of classic promoter domains 11 and subsequently identified several new features of estrogen receptor transcription, including an involvement of distal cis-regulatory enhancer regions and a requirement for the Forkhead protein, FoxA1, in facilitating estrogen receptor binding to chromatin and subsequent gene transcription 11 . This analysis highlighted the importance of regions of chromatin distinct from the promoter-proximal regions and suggested an in vivo requirement for cooperating transcription factors. However, owing to technological limitations, this investigation was restricted to chromosomes 21 and 22, comprising o3{\%} of the genome and containing few estrogen receptor–regulated genes 11 .

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Gene expression profiling of breast cancer has identified two biologically distinct estrogen receptor (ER)-positive subtypes of breast cancer: luminal A and luminal B. Luminal B tumors have higher proliferation and poorer prognosis than luminal A tumors. In this study, we developed a clinically practical immunohistochemistry assay to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors and investigated its ability to separate tumors according to breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival. METHODS: Tumors from a cohort of 357 patients with invasive breast carcinomas were subtyped by gene expression profile. Hormone receptor status, HER2 status, and the Ki67 index (percentage of Ki67-positive cancer nuclei) were determined immunohistochemically. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to determine the Ki67 cut point to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors. The prognostic value of the immunohistochemical assignment for breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival was investigated with an independent tissue microarray series of 4046 breast cancers by use of Kaplan-Meier curves and multivariable Cox regression. RESULTS: Gene expression profiling classified 101 (28{\%}) of the 357 tumors as luminal A and 69 (19{\%}) as luminal B. The best Ki67 index cut point to distinguish luminal B from luminal A tumors was 13.25{\%}. In an independent cohort of 4046 patients with breast cancer, 2847 had hormone receptor-positive tumors. When HER2 immunohistochemistry and the Ki67 index were used to subtype these 2847 tumors, we classified 1530 (59{\%}, 95{\%} confidence interval [CI] = 57{\%} to 61{\%}) as luminal A, 846 (33{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 31{\%} to 34{\%}) as luminal B, and 222 (9{\%}, 95{\%} CI = 7{\%} to 10{\%}) as luminal-HER2 positive. Luminal B and luminal-HER2-positive breast cancers were statistically significantly associated with poor breast cancer recurrence-free and disease-specific survival in all adjuvant systemic treatment categories. Of particular relevance are women who received tamoxifen as their sole adjuvant systemic therapy, among whom the 10-year breast cancer-specific survival was 79{\%} (95{\%} CI = 76{\%} to 83{\%}) for luminal A, 64{\%} (95{\%} CI = 59{\%} to 70{\%}) for luminal B, and 57{\%} (95{\%} CI = 47{\%} to 69{\%}) for luminal-HER2 subtypes. CONCLUSION: Expression of ER, progesterone receptor, and HER2 proteins and the Ki67 index appear to distinguish luminal A from luminal B breast cancer subtypes.},

abstract = {Lysine methylation has been traditionally associated with histones and epigenetics. Recently, lysine methyltransferases and demethylases - which are involved in methylation of non-histone substrates - have been frequently found deregulated in human tumours. In this realm, a new discovery has unveiled the methyltransferase SMYD3 as an enhancer of Ras-driven cancer. SMYD3 is up-regulated in different types of tumours. SMYD3-mediated methylation of MAP3K2 increases mutant K-Ras-induced activation of ERK1/2. Methylation of MAP3K2 prevents it from binding to the phosphatase PP2A, thereby impeding the impact of this negative regulator on Ras-ERK1/2 signals, leading to the formation of lung and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. Furthermore, depletion of SMYD3 synergises with a MEK inhibitor, currently in clinical trials, to block Ras-driven pancreatic neoplasia. These results underscore the importance of lysine methylation in the regulation of signalling pathways relevant for tumourigenesis and endorse the development of drugs targeting unregulated lysine methylation as therapeutic agents in the struggle against cancer.},

We also determined that Pdef protein is reduced in human invasive breast cancer and is absent in invasive breast cancer cell lines. We next assessed the functional consequences of these observations. Significantly, expression of Pdef in breast cancer cells leads to inhibition of invasion, migration, and growth. Expression of Pdef also results in the down-regulation of urokinase-type plasminogen activator and activation of the promoter of the tumor suppressor gene, MASPIN: Growth-suppressive effects of Pdef expression are mediated in part by a G(0)-G(1) cell cycle arrest associated with elevated p21 levels. Collectively, these results indicate that Pdef loss may alter the expression of genes controlling progression to invasive breast cancer.},

abstract = {We report that knocking down the expression of inositol polyphosphate 4-phosphatase type II (INPP4B) in human epithelial cells, like knockdown of PTEN, resulted in enhanced Akt activation and anchorage-independent growth and enhanced overall motility. In xenograft experiments, overexpression of INPP4B resulted in reduced tumor growth. INPP4B preferentially hydrolyzes phosphatidylinositol-3,4-bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P(2)) with no effect on phosphatidylinositol-3.4.5-triphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P(3)), suggesting that PI(3,4)P(2) and PI(3,4,5)P(3) may cooperate in Akt activation and cell transformation. Dual knockdown of INPP4B and PTEN resulted in cellular senescence. Finally, we found loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at the INPP4B locus in a majority of basal-like breast cancers, as well as in a significant fraction of ovarian cancers, which correlated with lower overall patient survival, suggesting that INPP4B is a tumor suppressor.},

abstract = {We describe the results of a genome-wide analysis of human cells that suggests that most protein-coding genes, including most genes thought to be transcriptionally inactive, experience transcription initiation. We found that nucleosomes with H3K4me3 and H3K9,14Ac modifications, together with RNA polymerase II, occupy the promoters of most protein-coding genes in human embryonic stem cells. Only a subset of these genes produce detectable full-length transcripts and are occupied by nucleosomes with H3K36me3 modifications, a hallmark of elongation. The other genes experience transcription initiation but show no evidence of elongation, suggesting that they are predominantly regulated at postinitiation steps. Genes encoding most developmental regulators fall into this group. Our results also identify a class of genes that are excluded from experiencing transcription initiation, at which mechanisms that prevent initiation must predominate. These observations extend to differentiated cells, suggesting that transcription initiation at most genes is a general phenomenon in human cells.},

abstract = {Chromosomal rearrangements of the 11p15 locus have been identified in hematopoietic malignancies, resulting in translocations involving the N-terminal portion of the nucleoporin gene NUP98. Fifteen different fusion partner genes have been identified for NUP98, and more than one half of these are homeobox transcription factors. By contrast, the NUP98 fusion partner in t(11;20) is Topoisomerase I (TOP1), a catalytic enzyme recognized for its key role in relaxing supercoiled DNA. We now show that retrovirally engineered expression of NUP98-TOP1 in murine bone marrow confers a potent in vitro growth advantage and a block in differentiation in hematopoietic precursors, evidenced by a competitive growth advantage in liquid culture, increased replating efficient of colony-forming cells (CFCs), and a marked increase in spleen colony-forming cell output. Moreover, in a murine bone marrow transplantation model, NUP98-TOP1 expression led to a lethal, transplantable leukemia characterized by extremely high white cell counts, splenomegaly, and mild anemia. Strikingly, a mutation to a TOP1 site to inactivate the isomerase activity essentially left unaltered the growth-promoting and leukemogenic effects of NUP98-TOP1. These findings, together with similar biologic effects reported for NUP98-HOX fusions, suggest unexpected, overlapping functions of NUP98 fusion genes, perhaps related to common DNA binding properties.},

In the laboratory, breast cancer is often modelled using established cell lines. In the present review we discuss some of the issues surrounding the use of breast cancer cell lines as experimental models, in light of these revised clinical classifications, and put forward suggestions for improving their use in translational breast cancer research.},

While adjuvant therapy with Tam has been shown to significantly decrease the rate of disease recurrence and mortality, recurrent disease occurs in one third of patients treated with Tam within 5 years of therapy. A better understanding of gene expression alterations associated with Tam resistance will facilitate circumventing this problem. Using a next generation sequencing approach and a new bioinformatics model, we compared the transcriptomes of Tam-sensitive and Tam-resistant breast cancer cells for identification of genes involved in the development of Tam resistance. We identified differential expression of 1215 mRNA and 513 small RNA transcripts clustered into ER$\alpha$ functions, cell cycle regulation, transcription/translation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The extent of alterations found at multiple levels of gene regulation highlights the ability of the Tam-resistant cells to modulate global gene expression. Alterations of small nucleolar RNA, oxidative phosphorylation, and proliferation processes in Tam-resistant cells present areas for diagnostic and therapeutic tool development for combating resistance to this anti-estrogen agent.},

First identified as dominant gain-of-function modifiers of the zeste1-white (z-w) interaction, mutant E(z) alleles also produce homeotic transformations. Reduction of E(z)+ activity leads to both suppression of the z-w interaction and ectopic expression of segment identity genes of the Antennapedia and bithorax gene complexes. This latter effect defines E(z) as a member of the Polycomb-group of genes. Analysis of E(z)S2, a temperature-sensitive E(z) allele, reveals that both maternally and zygotically produced E(z)+ activity is required to correctly regulate the segment identity genes during embryonic and imaginal development. As has been shown for other Polycomb-group genes, E(z)+ is required not to initiate the pattern of these genes, but rather to maintain their repressed state. We propose that the E(z) loss-of-function eye color and homeotic phenotypes may both be due to gene derepression, and that the E(z)+ product may be a general repressing factor required for both examples of negative gene regulation.},

To explore the genetic origin of OCCC, we determined the exomic sequences of eight tumors after immunoaffinity purification of cancer cells. Through comparative analyses of normal cells from the same patients, we identified four genes that were mutated in at least two tumors. PIK3CA, which encodes a subunit of phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase, and KRAS, which encodes a well-known oncoprotein, had previously been implicated in OCCC. The other two mutated genes were previously unknown to be involved in OCCC: PPP2R1A encodes a regulatory subunit of serine/threonine phosphatase 2, and ARID1A encodes adenine-thymine (AT)-rich interactive domain-containing protein 1A, which participates in chromatin remodeling. The nature and pattern of the mutations suggest that PPP2R1A functions as an oncogene and ARID1A as a tumor-suppressor gene. In a total of 42 OCCCs, 7{\%} had mutations in PPP2R1A and 57{\%} had mutations in ARID1A. These results suggest that aberrant chromatin remodeling contributes to the pathogenesis of OCCC.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Breast cancer cell lines have been used widely to investigate breast cancer pathobiology and new therapies. Breast cancer is a molecularly heterogeneous disease, and it is important to understand how well and which cell lines best model that diversity. In particular, microarray studies have identified molecular subtypes-luminal A, luminal B, ERBB2-associated, basal-like and normal-like-with characteristic gene-expression patterns and underlying DNA copy number alterations (CNAs). Here, we studied a collection of breast cancer cell lines to catalog molecular profiles and to assess their relation to breast cancer subtypes.

METHODS: Whole-genome DNA microarrays were used to profile gene expression and CNAs in a collection of 52 widely-used breast cancer cell lines, and comparisons were made to existing profiles of primary breast tumors. Hierarchical clustering was used to identify gene-expression subtypes, and Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to discover biological features of those subtypes. Genomic and transcriptional profiles were integrated to discover within high-amplitude CNAs candidate cancer genes with coordinately altered gene copy number and expression.

FINDINGS: Transcriptional profiling of breast cancer cell lines identified one luminal and two basal-like (A and B) subtypes. Luminal lines displayed an estrogen receptor (ER) signature and resembled luminal-A/B tumors, basal-A lines were associated with ETS-pathway and BRCA1 signatures and resembled basal-like tumors, and basal-B lines displayed mesenchymal and stem/progenitor-cell characteristics. Compared to tumors, cell lines exhibited similar patterns of CNA, but an overall higher complexity of CNA (genetically simple luminal-A tumors were not represented), and only partial conservation of subtype-specific CNAs. We identified 80 high-level DNA amplifications and 13 multi-copy deletions, and the resident genes with concomitantly altered gene-expression, highlighting known and novel candidate breast cancer genes.

CONCLUSIONS: Overall, breast cancer cell lines were genetically more complex than tumors, but retained expression patterns with relevance to the luminal-basal subtype distinction. The compendium of molecular profiles defines cell lines suitable for investigations of subtype-specific pathobiology, cancer stem cell biology, biomarkers and therapies, and provides a resource for discovery of new breast cancer genes.},

In colon and other cancers, mutations in APC or presumptive GSK3beta phosphorylation sites of beta-cat are associated with constitutive activation of Tcf/Lef transcription. In spite of assumptions about its oncogenic potential, prior efforts to demonstrate that mutated beta-cat will induce neoplastic transformation have yielded equivocal results. We report here that mutated, but not wild-type, beta-cat proteins induced neoplastic transformation of RK3E, an adenovirus E1A-immortalized epithelial cell line. Analysis of the properties of mutant beta-cat proteins and studies with a dominant negative Tcf-4 mutant indicated that the ability of beta-cat to bind and activate Tcf/Lef factors is crucial for transformation. c-myc has recently been implicated as a critical Tcf-regulated target gene. However, c-myc was not consistently activated in beta-cat-transformed RK3E cells, and a dominant negative c-Myc mutant protein failed to inhibit beta-cat transformation. Our findings underscore the role of beta-cat mutations and Tcf/Lef activation in cancer and illustrate a useful system for defining critical factors in beta-cat transformation.},

We now report that ER␣-dependent gene expression also is reg-ulated by protein phosphatase 2A (PP2A). ER␣ co-immu-noprecipitates with enzymatically active PP2A. ER␣ binds directly to the catalytic subunit of PP2A, which dephosphorylates serine 118 of the receptor. Amino ac-ids 176 –182 in the A/B domain of ER␣ are required for the interaction between PP2A and the receptor. Phos-phatase inhibition disrupts the ER␣-PP2A complex and induces formation of an ER␣-activated mitogen-acti-vated protein kinase complex, phosphorylation of ER␣ on serine 118, and transcriptional activation. These findings demonstrate that estrogen receptors exist in complexes with phosphatases as well as kinases. We pro-pose a new model of ligand-independent activation of estrogen receptors in which the level of phosphoryla-tion of ER␣, and hence its transcriptional activation, is determined by the net effect of these counterregulatory pathways.},

abstract = {Somatic mutations have been extensively characterized in breast cancer, but the                 effects of these genetic alterations on the proteomic landscape remain poorly                 understood. Here we describe quantitative mass-spectrometry-based proteomic and                 phosphoproteomic analyses of 105 genomically annotated breast cancers, of which 77                 provided high-quality data. Integrated analyses provided insights into the somatic                 cancer genome including the consequences of chromosomal loss, such as the 5q                 deletion characteristic of basal-like breast cancer. Interrogation of the 5q                     trans-effects against the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular                 Signatures, connected loss of CETN3 and SKP1 to elevated expression of                 epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and SKP1 loss also to increased SRC                 tyrosine kinase. Global proteomic data confirmed a stromal-enriched group of                 proteins in addition to basal and luminal clusters, and pathway analysis of the                 phosphoproteome identified a G-protein-coupled receptor cluster that was not readily                 identified at the mRNA level. In addition to ERBB2, other amplicon-associated highly                 phosphorylated kinases were identified, including CDK12, PAK1, PTK2, RIPK2 and TLK2.                 We demonstrate that proteogenomic analysis of breast cancer elucidates the                 functional consequences of somatic mutations, narrows candidate nominations for                 driver genes within large deletions and amplified regions, and identifies                 therapeutic targets.},

abstract = {We present a systematic comparison of three modules that enhance expression from retroviral gene transfer vectors at a posttranscriptional level: (i) splice signals (SS) that create an intron in the 5' untranslated region; (ii) constitutive RNA transport elements (CTE), originally discovered in D-type retroviruses; and (iii) the posttranscriptional regulatory element of woodchuck hepatitis virus (WPRE). Here we show that enhancement of expression depends not only on the specific element, but also on the gene of interest, implying context-dependent activity of the RNA elements. Interestingly, different results were obtained for genes that normally require or do not require such control elements. Expression of the HIV-1 gag-protease gene, which normally depends on the viral export factor Rev, was strongly enhanced by an oligomeric CTE, while WPRE had only a marginal effect. On the other hand, both CTE and WPRE compensated for the lack of an intron in the expression of human beta-globin. In this case, the strongest stimulation of RNA production was observed when functional SS were combined with the WPRE. Both CTE and, in particular, WPRE also enhanced expression of cDNAs that do not normally require any such element (green fluorescent protein, human multidrug resistance-1). In this study, functional SS and WPRE acted in an additive manner, resulting in a 10-fold higher level of expression. Our results indicate that the described modules act on different levels of RNA processing, transport, and translation and that the correct choice of a posttranscriptional enhancer configuration depends on the type of cDNA to be expressed.},

Patients and Methods: 62 BC patients previously nottreated with chemo- or radiotherapy were included in the study. All tumors belong to invasive ductal carcinoma of different grade. Expression of molecular markers was determined by immunohistochemical analysis on paraffin-embedded tissue sections. Results: The correlation between tumor grade and expression of ER, PR, Ki-67 and p53 was defined. NF-kappaB expression was found to be changed dependent on expression of ER, PR and p53 and also on molecular subtype (luminal, Her2-positive, hybrid, basal-like). The highest levels of NF-kappaB, Ki-67 and p53 were found in Her2/neu+ and basal-like tumor subtypes. Conclusion: The increase of nuclear expression of NF-kappaB correlates with a decrease of expression of steroid hormone receptors (ER and PR), increase of p53 accumulation, and is associated with Her2-positive and basal-like tumor types.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Ovarian clear-cell and endometrioid carcinomas may arise from endometriosis, but the molecular events involved in this transformation have not been described. METHODS: We sequenced the whole transcriptomes of 18 ovarian clear-cell carcinomas and 1 ovarian clear-cell carcinoma cell line and found somatic mutations in ARID1A (the AT-rich interactive domain 1A [SWI-like] gene) in 6 of the samples. ARID1A encodes BAF250a, a key component of the SWI-SNF chromatin remodeling complex. We sequenced ARID1A in an additional 210 ovarian carcinomas and a second ovarian clear-cell carcinoma cell line and measured BAF250a expression by means of immunohistochemical analysis in an additional 455 ovarian carcinomas. RESULTS: ARID1A mutations were seen in 55 of 119 ovarian clear-cell carcinomas (46{\%}), 10 of 33 endometrioid carcinomas (30{\%}), and none of the 76 high-grade serous ovarian carcinomas. Seventeen carcinomas had two somatic mutations each. Loss of the BAF250a protein correlated strongly with the ovarian clear-cell carcinoma and endometrioid carcinoma subtypes and the presence of ARID1A mutations. In two patients, ARID1A mutations and loss of BAF250a expression were evident in the tumor and contiguous atypical endometriosis but not in distant endometriotic lesions. CONCLUSIONS: These data implicate ARID1A as a tumor-suppressor gene frequently disrupted in ovarian clear-cell and endometrioid carcinomas. Since ARID1A mutation and loss of BAF250a can be seen in the preneoplastic lesions, we speculate that this is an early event in the transformation of endometriosis into cancer.

It is known to dephosphorylate over 300 substrates involved in the cell cycle, regulating almost all major pathways and cell cycle checkpoints. PP2A is involved in such diverse processes by the formation of structurally distinct families of holoenzymes, which are regulated spatially and temporally by specific regulators. Here, we review the involvement of PP2A in the regulation of three cell signaling pathways: wnt, mTOR and MAP kinase, as well as the G1→S transition, DNA synthesis and mitotic initiation. These processes are all crucial for proper cell survival and proliferation and are often deregulated in cancer and other diseases.},

abstract = {Next-generation sequencing of follicular lymphoma and diffuse-large B-cell lymphoma has revealed frequent somatic, heterozygous Y641 mutations in the histone methyltransferase EZH2. Heterozygosity and the presence of equal quantities of both mutant and wild-type mRNA and expressed protein suggest a dominant mode of action. Surprisingly, B-cell lymphoma cell lines and lymphoma samples harboring heterozygous EZH2(Y641) mutations have increased levels of histone H3 Lys-27-specific trimethylation (H3K27me3). Expression of EZH2(Y641F/N) mutants in cells with EZH2(WT) resulted in an increase of H3K27me3 levels in vivo. Structural modeling of EZH2(Y641) mutants suggests a "Tyr/Phe switch" model whereby structurally neutral, nontyrosine residues at position 641 would decrease affinity for unmethylated and monomethylated H3K27 substrates and potentially favor trimethylation. We demonstrate, using in vitro enzyme assays of reconstituted PRC2 complexes, that Y641 mutations result in a decrease in monomethylation and an increase in trimethylation activity of the enzyme relative to the wild-type enzyme. This represents the first example of a disease-associated gain-of-function mutation in a histone methyltransferase, whereby somatic EZH2 Y641 mutations in lymphoma act dominantly to increase, rather than decrease, histone methylation. The dominant mode of action suggests that allele-specific EZH2 inhibitors should be a future therapeutic strategy for this disease.},

abstract = {Axin1 and its homolog Axin2/conductin/Axil are negative regulators of the canonical Wnt pathway that suppress signal transduction by promoting degradation of beta-catenin. Mice with deletion of Axin1 exhibit defects in axis determination and brain patterning during early embryonic development. We show that Axin2 is expressed in the osteogenic fronts and periosteum of developing sutures during skull morphogenesis. Targeted disruption of Axin2 in mice induces malformations of skull structures, a phenotype resembling craniosynostosis in humans. In the mutants, premature fusion of cranial sutures occurs at early postnatal stages. To elucidate the mechanism of craniosynostosis, we studied intramembranous ossification in Axin2-null mice. The calvarial osteoblast development is significantly affected by the Axin2 mutation. The Axin2 mutant displays enhanced expansion of osteoprogenitors, accelerated ossification, stimulated expression of osteogenic markers and increases in mineralization. Inactivation of Axin2 promotes osteoblast proliferation and differentiation in vivo and in vitro. Furthermore, as the mammalian skull is formed from cranial skeletogenic mesenchyme, which is derived from mesoderm and neural crest, our data argue for a region-specific effect of Axin2 on neural crest dependent skeletogenesis. The craniofacial anomalies caused by the Axin2 mutation are mediated through activation of beta-catenin signaling, suggesting a novel role for the Wnt pathway in skull morphogenesis.},

We report the structure of a ternary complex including DIM-5, S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, and a substrate H3 peptide. The histone tail inserts as a parallel strand between two DIM-5 strands, completing a hybrid sheet. Three post-SET cysteines coordinate a zinc atom together with Cys242 from the SET signature motif (NHXCXPN) near the active site. Consequently, a narrow channel is formed to accommodate the target Lys9 side chain. The sulfur atom of S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine, where the transferable methyl group is to be attached in S-adenosyl-L-methionine, lies at the opposite end of the channel, approximately 4 A away from the target Lys9 nitrogen. Structural comparison of the active sites of DIM-5, an H3 Lys9 trimethyltransferase, and SET7/9, an H3 Lys4 monomethyltransferase, allowed us to design substitutions in both enzymes that profoundly alter their product specificities without affecting their catalytic activities.},
